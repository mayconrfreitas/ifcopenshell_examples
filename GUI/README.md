# GUI Treeviewer Example

This is a basic example of a GUI IFC application, written in Python and using the ifcopenshell library. The Graphical User Interface uses the Qt libraries, more in particular the PyQt5 library. As an alternative and with minimal code changes, it can also use the PySide libraries.

It is not a full viewer, but uses a Tree widget to display the Spatial hierarchy.
