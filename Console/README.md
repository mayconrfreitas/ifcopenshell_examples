# Minimal Console Example

This is a very basic example of a minimal console IFC application, written in Python and using the ifcopenshell library.

It opens a file and returns the Spatial Hierachy, starting from the one and only `IfcProject` entity.


# IFCOPSPrintHierarchy

More advanced console example, which expands the minimal example with the full list of all properties, quantities and type.
