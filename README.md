Series of examples on how to use IfcOpenShell https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell as a general-purpose IFC library.

Primary focus is on Python examples, with and without interface.
See the Wiki for more in-depth explanation for the different examples.

A second objective is to collect all examples into one, more comprehensive IFC-viewer.
